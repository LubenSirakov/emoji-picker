# emoji-picker
In this project I had developed a concept for a custom emoji picker to be integrated in a trading app, 
which ended up not being used as the task was later scrapped.

The feature was intended for usage in both web and mobile apps(iOS and Android), using React Native.
I tried using different emoji sets, before settling with Twemoji. It has web support, but I had to develop a
custom implementation for mobile.
